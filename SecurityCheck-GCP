## 🎯 Objective

To ensure secure deployment, management, and scaling of cloud workloads while protecting identities, data, supply chain artifacts, keys, and network infrastructure from unauthorized access and compromise.

---

## 🔐 1. Identity & Authentication (SSO / MFA / Workload Identity)

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| User identity | Must use **SSO via Google Workspace / Entra / Okta**; no personal gmail accounts. |
| MFA enforcement | Mandatory for all users with GCP access. |
| Service accounts | Must not be used for human access. |
| Workload identity | Must use **Workload Identity Federation** instead of static keys. |
| Keyless auth | CI/CD tools must authenticate via **OIDC Federation**, not key files. |

---

## 🔑 2. IAM & Least-Privilege Access

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Role policy | Only predefined least-privilege roles allowed (no `Owner`, no custom wide roles). |
| User roles | Must be granted via Google Workspace groups, not individuals. |
| Service accounts | Must be scoped to a single workload & environment. |
| Admins | Restricted to **≤ 5 central cloud security administrators**. |
| External users | Approved only by Security + Expire every **90 days**. |

---

## 🔒 3. Key Management, Secrets, and Access Credentials

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Secret storage | All passwords, keys, tokens, API secrets must be stored in **Secret Manager**. |
| Key rotation | Automatic rotation required for CMKs + manual yearly review. |
| Key usage logs | KMS CryptoKey access logs must be forwarded to SIEM. |
| No static keys | Prohibited for CI/CD pipelines and deployed workloads. |
| OAuth credentials | Must enforce least scopes, short lifetime tokens, and IP restrictions. |

---

## 🛡 4. Network & Firewall Security

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Default networks | Default VPCs must be deleted; no public ingress. |
| Firewall | Explicit allow rules; deny by default. |
| External access | Public IPs prohibited for workloads unless approved. |
| Private access | Use Private Google Access for GCR, API, Artifact calls. |
| Encryption in transit | Must use TLS 1.2+; internal services use mTLS when supported. |

---

## 📦 5. Supply Chain Security (Artifacts, AI Models, Containers, CI/CD)

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Artifact registry | Only **Artifact Registry** or approved private registries allowed. |
| Image scanning | Mandatory vulnerability scan for each deploy (Container Analysis/Scanner). |
| Build provenance | Must use **SLSA-compliant Cloud Build provenance**. |
| npm/pip security | Internet registry access must go via private mirror/proxy. |
| AI/ML models | Stored in isolated secured storage with private network. |

---

## ⚙️ 6. Compute & Workload Security

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| GKE | Must use Workload Identity, Pod-level IAM, and Node Auto-Upgrade. |
| Cloud Run | Must run as dedicated service account, no root privileges. |
| VM security | Must enforce OS patching, Shielded VM & secure boot. |
| App Engine | Must use identity-aware firewall + private networking. |
| Data access | Workloads must not use keys; only OIDC + IAM bindings. |

---

## 🔑 7. Secrets & Environment Variables (Prod Workloads)

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Secrets | Must not be stored in Cloud Build YAML, Dockerfiles, Terraform, or source code. |
| Runtime retrieval | Only via Secret Manager & workload identity. |
| Rotations | Business critical secrets rotated every **90 days**. |
| Exposure monitoring | Secret access logs must alert on unusual access patterns. |

---

## 🧪 8. Logging, Monitoring, & Security Command Center

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Audit logs | Must be enabled org-wide (Admin, Data, Access logs). |
| Log retention | Minimum retention = **1 year**. |
| SCC | Security Command Center (SCC) must be enabled at **Enterprise level**. |
| Alerting required for |  
- IAM changes  
- Key usage  
- New external IPs  
- Firewall rule changes  
- Secret access anomalous requests |
| SIEM | Logs must be streamed to central SIEM (Splunk/Sentinel/Elastic). |

---

## 🚨 9. Data Security & Storage

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Default encryption | Must use Google-managed encryption or CMEK when sensitive. |
| Bucket policies | Public access disabled org-wide; required uniform bucket-level access. |
| Sensitive buckets | Must enforce VPC Service Controls + Access Justification. |
| Object versioning | Must be enabled for sensitive storage. |

---

## 🔍 10. Governance, Audits, and Continuous Compliance

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Quarterly review | IAM roles, service accounts, keys, firewall rules. |
| Annual audit | Workload identity, data sensitivity, pipeline security. |
| Policy review | Updated annually by Security Leadership. |
| Enforcement | Non-compliant workloads may be disabled or blocked from deployment. |
